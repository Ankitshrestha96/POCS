# Hello World

This is a test. I would like code and MathJax working.

```
import panoptes.utils.logger as logger

@logger.has_logger
class FooBar():
  """ This class is FooBar! """
  def __init__(self):
    self.logger.info('Inside Class')
```

The equation for inline math ($z = 1.4$) is working.

$$ z = \frac{\lambda_{obs} - \lambda_{em}}{\lambda_{em}} $$

Interesting.
